# About

An improved web client for an esoteric, idiosyncratic chat system. It is written in plain vanilla Javascript and has made little or no effort to follow anyone's idea of best practices. You're welcome.

# Contributing

Don't bother.

(Alternatively, if you really, *really* must, you could try telling me about your idea. Maybe we can work something out.)

This software is merely a user-interface improvement for infrastructure that is the work of clever and knowledgeable people who are definitely not me. Without their work to build upon, it probably would not exist, and certainly would not exist in this form.

It also relies upon a couple of third-party Javascript libraries:

* [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice) for keyboard bindings
* [ansi\_up](https://github.com/drudru/ansi_up) to process ANSI escape sequences into HTML
